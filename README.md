# NodeJS Reddit Front Page Scraper
Download all images from the front page of a chosen subreddit.

### Installation
Clone the repo, open a terminal in folder, and type the 'npm install'
then use 'node redditFrontPage.js'.

### Usage
After installation, enter a subreddit name and hit enter, the script
will download all images from the subreddit's front page to /images/.

The images downloaded use Reddit IDs as filenames, meaning different
subreddits' images should separate in the /images/ folder.
